## Overview
A comprehensive settings management system that allows administrators to configure various aspects of the e-commerce platform through a user-friendly interface.

## User Stories

### As an Administrator

#### 1. View Settings by Group
- **I want to** view all settings organized by groups (System, Payment, Security, Email, Integration, Localization, SEO, Analytics, Shipping, Store)
- **So that** I can easily find and manage related configurations

#### 2. Edit Settings
- **I want to** edit setting values based on their type:
  - text
  - url
  - encrypted_text
  - email
  - domain
  - boolean
  - number
  - select
  - json
  - color
  - file
  - textarea
  - date
  - time
  - array
- **So that** I can configure the platform according to business needs

#### 3. Validate Settings
- **I want** settings to be validated according to their type with:
  - Required/optional flag
  - Validation rules (regex patterns, min/max values)
  - Help text/descriptions
- **So that** I can ensure only valid configurations are saved

#### 4. View Setting Details
- **I want to** see each setting's description and validation rules
- **So that** I understand what each setting does and what values are acceptable

#### 5. Search Settings
- **I want to** search for settings by name or description
- **So that** I can quickly find specific configurations

#### 6. Export Settings
- **I want to** export all or selected settings to JSON or XML format
- **So that** I can backup configurations or migrate them to another environment

#### 7. Import Settings
- **I want to** import settings from JSON or XML files
- **So that** I can restore configurations or apply settings from another environment

#### 8. View Change History
- **I want to** see an audit log of all setting changes (who changed what and when)
- **So that** I can track configuration changes and troubleshoot issues

### As a Developer

#### 9. Access Settings Programmatically
- **I want to** use SettingsService with these methods:
  - `getSettingsByGroup(group: string)`
  - `getSettingByKey(group: string, key: string)`
- **So that** I can use configurations throughout the API system

#### 10. Type-Safe Settings
- **I want** settings to be strongly typed based on their configuration type
- **So that** I can handle them appropriately in the code

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Settings Organization**
   - Settings are properly grouped and displayed in the admin interface
   - Groups are easily navigable with clear labels

2. **Data Validation**
   - All setting types are properly validated on save
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Validation rules are enforced both client and server side

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Changes are logged with user, timestamp, old value, and new value
   - Audit logs are viewable in the admin interface

4. **Import/Export**
   - Settings can be exported to JSON or XML format
   - Imported settings are validated before applying
   - Import process shows preview of changes

5. **API Integration**
   - SettingsService provides efficient access to settings with caching
   - Settings are loaded once and cached until updated
   - Cache invalidation on setting updates

6. **Security**
   - Encrypted settings (encrypted_text type) are properly secured in the database
   - Sensitive settings are not exposed in export unless explicitly requested

7. **File Management**
   - File uploads for settings are stored in S3
   - Old files are cleaned up when settings are updated

8. **User Experience**
   - UI provides clear feedback on validation errors
   - Success messages on save
   - Loading states during operations

9. **Performance**
   - Settings changes take effect immediately without system restart
   - Bulk operations are optimized for performance

## Out of Scope
- Setting dependencies (one setting affecting another)
- Environment-specific settings (dev/staging/prod)
- Approval workflows for setting changes
- Real-time settings synchronization across multiple instances
