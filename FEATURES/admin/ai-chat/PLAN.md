# AI Agent Chat Implementation Plan

## Overview
Step-by-step implementation of the AI Agent Chat feature for Museo Admin, creating a copilot-style assistant panel with drag-and-drop capabilities and mock AI responses.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Localization Keys
- [x] Add AI chat translations to `/src/i18n/locales/en.json`
- [x] Add Spanish translations to `/src/i18n/locales/es.json`
- [x] Include all keys from design: title, modes, placeholders, progress messages
- [x] Test translations load correctly
- [x] Run `npm run type-check` to verify no breaking changes

### Step 2: Create AIChatStore with Zustand
- [x] Create `/src/shared/store/AIChatStore.ts`
- [x] Define interfaces for ChatMessage, Attachment, ProcessingStep
- [x] Implement state management for chat UI and messages
- [x] Add localStorage persistence for settings only
- [x] Create actions for message handling and UI control
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript correctness

### Step 3: Add AI Chat SCSS Styles
- [x] Create `/src/styles/components/_ai-chat.scss`
- [x] Import in `/src/styles/main.scss`
- [x] Define styles for panel, messages, input area
- [x] Use existing variables and mixins from design system
- [x] Implement responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify SCSS compilation

### Step 4: Create Base AI Chat Components
- [x] Create `/src/shared/components/organisms/AIChat/` directory
- [x] Implement `AIChat.tsx` as main container
- [x] Create `AIChatPanel.tsx` with slide animation
- [x] Add `index.ts` for barrel exports
- [x] Integrate with AdminLayout
- [ ] Run build verification

### Step 5: Implement Chat Header Components
- [ ] Create `AIChatHeader.tsx` with minimize/close buttons
- [ ] Implement `AIChatModelSelector.tsx` dropdown
- [ ] Create `AIChatModeToggle.tsx` for Ask/Agent modes
- [ ] Connect to AIChatStore for state management
- [ ] Test model and mode selection persistence
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to check code style

### Step 6: Build Message Display Components
- [ ] Create `AIChatMessages.tsx` container with scroll
- [ ] Implement `AIChatMessage.tsx` with markdown support
- [ ] Add attachment pill display with Heroicons
- [ ] Style user vs assistant messages differently
- [ ] Test message rendering and scrolling
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` for type safety

### Step 7: Implement Input and Send Functionality
- [ ] Create `AIChatInput.tsx` with textarea
- [ ] Add send button and keyboard handling
- [ ] Implement character limits and validation
- [ ] Connect to store for sending messages
- [ ] Add loading states during processing
- [ ] Test message sending flow

### Step 8: Add Drag and Drop Support
- [ ] Create `AIChatDropZone.tsx` overlay component
- [ ] Implement HTML5 drag and drop handlers
- [ ] Detect file, folder, and HTML element drops
- [ ] Show visual feedback during drag
- [ ] Add dropped items as attachments
- [ ] Test drag and drop from file system and page

### Step 9: Implement Mock AI Responses
- [ ] Create response generator based on mode
- [ ] Add markdown examples in responses
- [ ] Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Echo user message and list attachments
- [ ] Implement different response lengths for Ask vs Agent
- [ ] Test response generation

### Step 10: Add Task Progress Indication
- [ ] Create `AIChatProgress.tsx` component
- [ ] Show multi-step progress for Agent mode
- [ ] Animate step transitions
- [ ] Connect to processing state in store
- [ ] Add mock delays between steps
- [ ] Test progress flow

### Step 11: Create Examples and Help
- [ ] Create `AIChatExamples.tsx` modal
- [ ] List example tasks for each mode
- [ ] Make examples clickable to populate input
- [ ] Localize all example text
- [ ] Add help icon to header
- [ ] Test examples modal

### Step 12: Integrate with AdminStore
- [ ] Add handlers for AI task execution
- [ ] Create mock product creation from CSV
- [ ] Show created items in admin UI
- [ ] Update chat with task results
- [ ] Test integration with product management
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify integration

### Step 13: Implement Responsive Design
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Ensure full-screen mode on small screens
- [ ] Verify touch interactions work
- [ ] Test landscape orientation
- [ ] Fix any responsive issues
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` on different devices

### Step 14: Add Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Implement Escape key to close panel
- [ ] Add Tab navigation through elements
- [ ] Support arrow keys in message list
- [ ] Test keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Ensure no conflicts with admin shortcuts
- [ ] Test with screen readers

### Step 15: Final Testing and Polish
- [ ] Test complete user flow
- [ ] Verify localStorage persistence
- [ ] Check all localization works
- [ ] Test error states
- [ ] Performance optimization if needed
- [ ] Run all npm scripts: `lint`, `type-check`, `build`

## Testing Checklist

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Chat opens and closes properly
- [ ] Messages send and display correctly
- [ ] Drag and drop works for all types
- [ ] Model and mode selection persists
- [ ] Mock responses generate properly
- [ ] Progress indication shows correctly
- [ ] New conversation clears chat
- [ ] Examples populate input field

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
- [ ] Colors match admin theme
- [ ] Icons display correctly
- [ ] Scrolling works properly
- [ ] Loading states show appropriately
- [ ] Error states handle gracefully

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Works with existing admin pages
- [ ] Doesn't break other functionality
- [ ] Integrates with AdminStore
- [ ] Respects current locale
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts don't conflict

## Notes

- This is a UI-only implementation with mock responses
- No actual AI integration in this phase
- Focus on UX and visual design
- All text must be localized
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Test thoroughly at each step before proceeding
