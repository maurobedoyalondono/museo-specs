# MCP E-commerce System - User Stories

## Overview
This document contains user stories for implementing the MCP (Model Context Protocol) E-commerce System that will orchestrate natural language interactions with the Museo platform.

## Epic: MCP E-commerce Orchestration System

### Story 1: MCP Orchestrator Setup
**As a** system architect  
**I want** a WebSocket-based orchestrator server  
**So that** external clients can connect to a single endpoint and have their requests routed to appropriate MCP servers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Orchestrator runs on port 3300
- [ ] Accepts WebSocket connections from external clients
- [ ] Manages stdio communication with MCP subprocesses
- [ ] Handles process lifecycle (start/stop/restart)
- [ ] Implements request routing based on intent
- [ ] Caches conversations in Redis

### Story 2: Machine-to-Machine Authentication
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** secure M2M authentication for admin API calls  
**So that** MCP servers can securely access protected admin endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] MCP servers can authenticate with the existing API
- [ ] Admin endpoints are protected with appropriate credentials
- [ ] Authentication tokens are managed securely
- [ ] Support for service accounts or API keys

### Story 3: Intent Analysis MCP
**As a** user sending natural language messages  
**I want** my intent to be automatically understood  
**So that** the system can route my request to the appropriate service

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Analyzes message content and conversation context
- [ ] Supports multiple languages (en, es, fr)
- [ ] Uses pattern matching for common intents
- [ ] Falls back to AI analysis for complex intents
- [ ] Returns structured intent with confidence score

### Story 4: E-commerce Admin MCP
**As an** admin user  
**I want** to manage products through natural language  
**So that** I can perform admin tasks without complex UI navigation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create products from natural language descriptions
- [ ] Update product information
- [ ] Delete products
- [ ] Import products from files (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- [ ] All operations use existing admin API endpoints

### Story 5: E-commerce Storefront MCP
**As a** customer  
**I want** to shop using natural language  
**So that** I can find products and make purchases conversationally

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Search products using natural language
- [ ] Get detailed product information
- [ ] Add items to basket
- [ ] View basket contents
- [ ] Get payment links
- [ ] Answer product-related questions

### Story 6: Notifications MCP
**As a** system  
**I want** to send notifications through multiple channels  
**So that** users receive important updates via their preferred method

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Send emails with templates
- [ ] Send SMS messages
- [ ] Send WhatsApp messages
- [ ] Support multiple languages
- [ ] Handle delivery status

### Story 7: Web Admin Integration
**As a** web admin user  
**I want** the admin interface to use MCP for operations  
**So that** I benefit from the intelligent routing and natural language processing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Web admin connects to MCP orchestrator via WebSocket
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Natural language input option added
- [ ] Response formatting appropriate for web UI

### Story 8: Multi-Client Support
**As a** developer  
**I want** clear examples of different client integrations  
**So that** I can easily connect various platforms to the MCP system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] WhatsApp webhook integration example
- [ ] Web client integration example
- [ ] Mobile app integration example
- [ ] CLI testing tool
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

### Story 9: Conversation Management
**As a** returning user  
**I want** my conversation context preserved  
**So that** the system understands follow-up questions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Conversations cached in Redis
- [ ] Context retrieved for returning users
- [ ] Conversation history influences intent analysis
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of old conversations

### Story 10: Locale Detection and Response Formatting
**As an** international user  
**I want** responses in my language  
**So that** I can interact with the system naturally

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Locale detected from phone numbers (WhatsApp)
- [ ] Locale detected from browser headers (web)
- [ ] Responses formatted according to locale
- [ ] Currency and date formatting per locale

### Story 11: Error Handling and Monitoring
**As a** system operator  
**I want** comprehensive error handling and monitoring  
**So that** I can maintain system reliability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Graceful error handling at all levels
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Process monitoring and auto-restart
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

### Story 12: Development and Testing Tools
**As a** developer  
**I want** tools to test and debug the MCP system  
**So that** I can efficiently develop and troubleshoot

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CLI tool for testing MCP interactions
- [ ] Mock mode for AI providers
- [ ] Request/response logging
- [ ] Performance profiling tools
- [ ] Unit and integration test suites
