# Process Designer - User Stories

## Epic: Visual Customer Journey Designer
Create a visual tool to design, manage, and test customer journeys in the MCP orchestrator system.

### User Personas
1. **Business Analyst (BA)**: Understands customer needs, designs conversation flows
2. **Developer (DEV)**: Implements tools and intents, needs technical details
3. **Product Manager (PM)**: Oversees customer experience, needs overview
4. **QA Engineer (QA)**: Tests conversation flows, validates responses

- Specify output data structure
- Set mandatory context data requirements
- Configure which tools this tool can trigger

### 5. Client-Tool Mapping
**As a** PM

- Bulk operations (enable all, disable all)
- Visual indicators for tool availability
- Validation warnings for missing dependencies

### 6. Test Message Simulation
**As a** QA

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Input field for test message
- Select client type and locale
- Animated visualization of execution flow
- Step-by-step breakdown showing:
  - Intent detection results
  - Tool execution order
  - Data passed between tools
  - Final response composition
- Ability to pause and inspect each step

### 7. Journey Comparison

- Side-by-side journey visualization
- Highlight differences (added/removed/modified)
- Version history with timestamps
- Ability to revert to previous versions
- Export comparison report

### 8. Data Flow Visualization
**As a** DEV  
**I want to** see how data flows between tools  
**So that** I can debug and optimize integrations  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Show data schema for each tool
- Visualize data transformation between tools
- Highlight required vs optional fields
- Show example data at each step
- Identify data dependencies

### 9. Journey Templates
**As a** BA  
**I want to** use pre-built journey templates  
**So that** I can quickly implement common patterns  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Template library with common journeys

**I want to** collaborate on journey design in real-time  
**So that** we can work together efficiently  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple users can view same journey
- See other users' cursors and selections
- Changes sync in real-time
- Comment on specific nodes
- Activity log shows who made what changes

### 11. Export and Documentation
**As a** DEV  
**I want to** export journey configurations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Export tool-definitions.json
- Export client-tools.json
- Generate intent pattern files
- Create journey documentation (PDF/Markdown)
- API to fetch configurations programmatically

### 12. Performance Analytics
**As a** PM  
**I want to** see analytics on journey performance  
**So that** I can optimize customer experience  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Show usage statistics per intent/tool
- Identify bottlenecks in journeys
- Success/failure rates for tools
- Average response times
